I'm **18 years** old, passionate about all things IT.
I specialize in Microsoft technologies such as **Active Directory**, **Entra ID / Azure**, **MECM** (formerly SCCM), and others. I also enjoy participating in **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenges, and I plan to create my own private team soon to steadily develop my skills.

I currently hold several certifications, including **eJPT**, **CRTP**, **CRTE**, **CRTM**, **CESP-ADCS**, and **CRTA**. I have also completed professional labs on Hack The Box, such as **FullHouse** and **APTLabs**. At the moment, I am working toward obtaining the **CARTP** certification.

What drives me most is understanding technologies at their deepest design level, making sure no detail is overlooked.
